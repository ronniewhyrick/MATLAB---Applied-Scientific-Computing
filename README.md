Project 1: Root finder through Secant, Newton Raphson, &amp; Taylor Series 
This project we took various example functions and plotted roots to accuracy using various mathematical methods described above. 
This was done in two parts: the first part involved making the mathematical functions by hand, the second part used the MATLAB commands of these functions to test the accuracy & Precision 
The results are described in the Lab Report
***Note: I'd Like to apologize, the format seemed to have jumbled up a bit and out of order for the code. however when re-entered into a compiler the code will execute again.
